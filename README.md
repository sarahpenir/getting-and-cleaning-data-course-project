# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Overview

The UC Irvine Human Activity Recognition (UC HAR) database was built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The purpose of this project is to successfully collect, work with, and clean the data set.

## Contents of the Repository

The repository contains the following files:

1. ```README.md``` - provides a description of the contents of the repository
2. ```CodeBook.md``` - describes the variables, data, and transformations that were performed to clean up the data
3. ```run_analysis.R``` - performs the necessary transformations on the original data set 
4. ```tidydata.txt``` - the final tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
